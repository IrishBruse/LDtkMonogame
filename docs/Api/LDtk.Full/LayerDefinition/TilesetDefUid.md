# LayerDefinition.TilesetDefUid property

Reference to the default Tileset UID being used by this layer definition.WARNING: some layer *instances* might use a different tileset. So most of the time, you should probably use the `__tilesetDefUid` value found in layer instances. Note: since version 1.0.0, the old `autoTilesetDefUid` was removed and merged into this value.

```csharp
public int? TilesetDefUid { get; set; }
```
