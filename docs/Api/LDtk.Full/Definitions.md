# Definitions class

If you're writing your own LDtk importer, you should probably just ignore *most* stuff in the `defs` section, as it contains data that are mostly important to the editor. To keep you away from the `defs` section and avoid some unnecessary JSON parsing, important data from definitions is often duplicated in fields prefixed with a double underscore (eg. `__identifier` or `__type`). The 2 only definition types you might need here are Tilesets and Enums.

```csharp
public class Definitions
```
