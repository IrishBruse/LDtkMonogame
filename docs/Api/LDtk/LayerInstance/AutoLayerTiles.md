# LayerInstance.AutoLayerTiles property

An array containing all tiles generated by Auto-layer rules. The array is already sorted in display order (ie. 1st tile is beneath 2nd, which is beneath 3rd etc.). Note: if multiple tiles are stacked in the same cell as the result of different rules, all tiles behind opaque ones will be discarded.

```csharp
public TileInstance[] AutoLayerTiles { get; set; }
```
