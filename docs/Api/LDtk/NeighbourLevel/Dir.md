# NeighbourLevel.Dir property

A lowercase string tipping on the level location (`n`orth, `s`outh, `w`est, `e`ast). Since 1.4.0, this value can also be &lt; (neighbour depth is lower), &gt; (neighbour depth is greater) or `o` (levels overlap and share the same world depth). Since 1.5.3, this value can also be `nw`,`ne`,`sw` or `se` for levels only touching corners.

```csharp
public string Dir { get; set; }
```
