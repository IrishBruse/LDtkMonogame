# LDtkFile.Worlds property

This array will be empty, unless you enable the Multi-Worlds in the project advanced settings. - in current version, a LDtk project file can only contain a single world with multiple levels in it. In this case, levels and world layout related settings are stored in the root of the JSON. - with "Multi-worlds" enabled, there will be a `worlds` array in root, each world containing levels and layout settings. Basically, it's pretty much only about moving the `levels` array to the `worlds` array, along with world layout related values (eg. `worldGridWidth` etc).If you want to start supporting this future update easily, please refer to this documentation: https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/231

```csharp
public LDtkWorld[] Worlds { get; set; }
```
